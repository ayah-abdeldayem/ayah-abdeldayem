HEY!, I'm **Ayah Abdeldayem**.

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Kentucky, balancing school with building startups, doing cybersecurity engineering work, and creating cool projects that actually help people. I currently work as a **Cyber Analyst at UK Information Technology Services**, a **SOC and Automation Intern at Lexmark**, and an **App Developer at Build Space**.
I'm also the co-founder and CEO of **AFO Cyber, LLC**, a scam-detection and consumer-protection startup that won multiple pitch competitions and early funding.

I love blending cybersecurity, software engineering, entrepreneurship, and design into things that feel practical but still creative.
